# Rock Paper Scissors – Python CLI Game

A simple command-line Rock Paper Scissors game built in Python where the player competes against the computer (Seista).  
This project is designed for beginners to practice core Python concepts.

---

## Game Features

- Play against the computer
- Infinite rounds until the program is stopped
- Score tracking for both player and computer
- Random choice generation using Python’s `random` module
- Simple and interactive CLI interface

---

## Concepts Used

- `while` loop
- `if / elif / else` conditions
- Lists
- Variables and counters
- `random.choice()`
- User input handling

---

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed
2. Save the file as `rock_paper_scissors.py`
3. Run the program using:

```bash
python rock_paper_scissors.py
```

---

## How to Play

1. Start the game by entering `yes` or `y`
2. Enter one of the following choices when prompted:
   - `rock`
   - `paper`
   - `scissor`
3. The computer randomly selects its move
4. Scores are updated after each round

## Sample Output

```text
Welcome to the Rock Paper and Scissor
Hello Buddy, I am Seista
Do you want to play with me?
Enter your response here: yes

(Type Rock/Paper/Scissor): rock
Seista choose: scissor

Seista Score: 0
-------------------------------------------------
```

## Possible Improvements

- Add input validation for incorrect inputs
- Add an option to quit the game
- Convert the logic into reusable functions
- Implement an OOP-based version
- Add match limits such as Best of 5
